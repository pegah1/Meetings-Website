this project is about the Design & Implementation of Website for Organizing Meetings
so every group can register and set the location and several times as a date of their meeting
so the group members can select their suitable times and can add some comments about it
also the group creators have some special permissions such as the send the invitation to their friends
, edit the features of the meeting, and so forth.
 Also all of the new events and most popular choice are sent to the group members.
